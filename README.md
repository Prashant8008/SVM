🚀 Task 4 Completed: SVM for Classifying Cats and Dogs! 🐱🐶

Proud to share my latest achievement with Prodigy Info Tech! I have successfully implemented a Support Vector Machine (SVM) model to classify images of cats and dogs using the Kaggle dataset. 📸🐾

This model enhances accuracy in distinguishing between the two, contributing to more efficient image recognition systems. It's been a rewarding experience diving into machine learning algorithms for real-world applications!

Excited to continue pushing the boundaries in AI and image classification!
